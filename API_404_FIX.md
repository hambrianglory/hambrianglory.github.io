# üîß 404 API Routing Fix for Netlify Deployment

## Issue Summary
After deployment, login attempts were returning "Network error: HTTP error! status: 404" indicating the API routes were not being found by Netlify.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was related to:
1. **Incorrect API Redirects**: Manual redirects in netlify.toml were conflicting with @netlify/plugin-nextjs
2. **Absolute URL Construction**: Using environment variables that might not be available during runtime
3. **Missing Runtime Configuration**: API routes needed explicit runtime configuration for Netlify

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Simplified netlify.toml Configuration
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm ci && npm run build"
  publish = ".next"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  NPM_VERSION = "9"
  HUSKY = "0"
  NODE_OPTIONS = "--max-old-space-size=4096"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

# Remove manual redirects - let Next.js plugin handle API routes automatically

# CORS headers for API routes
[[headers]]
  for = "/api/*"
  [headers.values]
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "*"
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods = "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS"
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers = "Content-Type, Authorization"

# Catch-all redirect for SPA
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

**Key Changes:**
- ‚ùå Removed manual API redirects that were conflicting with the Next.js plugin
- ‚úÖ Let @netlify/plugin-nextjs handle API routing automatically
- ‚úÖ Kept CORS headers for proper API access
- ‚úÖ Kept catch-all redirect for client-side routing

### 2. Updated Login Page API Calls
```typescript
// OLD: Absolute URL construction
const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || window.location.origin;
const apiUrl = `${baseUrl}/api/auth/login`;

// NEW: Relative URL - let Netlify handle routing
const apiUrl = '/api/auth/login';
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ No dependency on environment variables for basic routing
- ‚úÖ Works consistently across environments
- ‚úÖ Simpler and more reliable

### 3. Enhanced API Route Configuration
```typescript
// Added explicit runtime configuration
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
export const revalidate = 0
export const runtime = 'nodejs'
```

### 4. Added API Test Endpoint
Created `/api/test` endpoint for debugging:
```typescript
// Test if API routing is working and environment variables are loaded
GET /api/test
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "message": "API test endpoint working!",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-09T...",
  "environment": "production",
  "hasJwtSecret": true,
  "hasAdminEmail": true
}
```

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test API Connectivity
Visit: `https://your-netlify-url.netlify.app/api/test`
- Should return JSON with environment info
- Should show environment variables are loaded

### 2. Test Login Functionality
- Go to login page
- Try logging in with: admin@hambrianglory.lk / HambrianGlory@2025!Admin
- Check browser console for detailed logs
- Should no longer show 404 errors

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
In Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables, ensure:
```
JWT_SECRET=hambrianglory_community_jwt_secret_2025_secure_key_for_auth
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@hambrianglory.lk
ADMIN_PASSWORD=HambrianGlory@2025!Admin
```

## Expected Results
- ‚úÖ `/api/test` should return 200 OK with environment info
- ‚úÖ Login should work without 404 errors
- ‚úÖ Successful authentication should redirect to dashboard
- ‚úÖ All API routes should be accessible

## If 404 Errors Persist
1. Check Netlify build logs for deployment errors
2. Verify @netlify/plugin-nextjs is working correctly
3. Test `/api/test` endpoint first to isolate routing issues
4. Check that environment variables are properly set in Netlify

## Status: Deployed and Ready for Testing ‚úÖ
All 404 API routing fixes have been implemented and deployed. The system should now properly route API requests through Netlify's serverless functions.
